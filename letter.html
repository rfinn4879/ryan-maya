                <h1>A Message To My Love</h1>
                <p><br>I always hoped that I’d find love and be happier than ever but I didn’t think it would happen so early or even at all really. I was really happy before I met you. Like really happy. I was ecstatic like all the time. I loved life and everything it had in store for me. I rarely felt anything but stress and happiness to be honest. I grew up watching disney and seeing everyone live a happy ever after with the love of their life, but I wasn’t sure I would ever truly get there. And plus, I was so happy already so I felt like love was just romanticized in movies. Come on, could I really be missing that much?

<br>
<br>
Because I seldom felt anything but bliss, I didn’t think it was possible to raise my happiness threshold but my god you sure as hell did it. (I’m tearing up right now writing this so I know my sentences are probably all over the place.) 
<br>
<br>
When I’m with you I feel like I’m on cloud 9 and I know I’m the luckiest person ever. I set out to accomplish a lot in life and I’ve gotten now most of the things I’ve ever really wanted. On that list, our relationship was the newest addition and it’s already become absolutely the best part of my life.
<br>
<br>
So I guess I should start at the start. [I remember the day I saw you first]. I also remember getting an excited nervousness when you stood next to me one day (during band camp still) in block. I would take quick glances at you but I didn’t want you to notice and despite this I still had that whole don’t-date-outside-your-grade attitude so I knew it wasn’t gonna work out anyway. I literally said to myself that I wanted to be in the same grade as you though. And I didn’t care which way it went either; I wanted to join your grade as much as I wanted you to join mine. I just figured then we would have a chance. I barely saw you once school had started though and I didn’t think about it much until I started seeing you at football games. Then we sat in the stands and talked that one game. I remember being quiet the whole time and thinking “if I don’t talk, I can’t make a mistake” but I wanted to talk too. I wanted to make you laugh and see your smile. I wanted to make a good impression. And I’m pretty sure I instagram stalked you sometime after that. Then marching season came to a close and I don’t think I really ever got to see you. 
<br>
<br>
That chapter of our life ended and I didn’t worry about it too much. Since I didn’t get too many opportunities to sit by you at football games, I didn’t think we even really had a chance. You are beautiful so I figured someone else would come and sweep you off your feet so, for the time, you really didn’t cross my mind much.
<br>
<br>
I was all giddy on that spring break trip when you talked to me all week WHILE ON VACATION. That was an amazing feeling! To know that you would take time to talk to me while you were out of town. And not only take time, but stay up into the morning to talk about the most random things with me. That was the first time that I began to entertain the idea that you shared similar feelings towards me. 
<br>
<br>
Initially I was so excited and nervous to talk to you that I wrote notes and never sent anything before proofreading it 11 times. (I still do this and that’s why I still take so long to respond) I even took pictures of your snaps on my iPad mini sometimes because I was so nervous that I would forget what you said or that I would say the wrong thing and ruin what was becoming my favorite thing ever: our relationship. When we started doing videos I would count how many little 6 second markers were sent between us and even before that, how many pictures. I would always try to gauge whether or not you were interested in what were were talking about and my nervous self didn’t want to overdo it and embarrass myself. I remember a few times letting the conversation die to see if you would try to save it or start a new topic to keep talking. I would also play these dumb little fantasy games where I would be thinking about you or something and I’d be going back in forth about whether you wanted to be in a relationship or you thought we were friends. I would act out full scenarios of me asking you out and prepared for weeks to make sure that I had a composed response to any rejection. Based on whatever was going on in my head at the time, if you responded, I thought that was how you felt or whatever. Asking for the universe to be my detective essentially. More often than not, it supported the concept that you loved me back, but I still couldn’t take that as accurate because I still rigged it in my favor. 
<br>
<br>
I wish I could tell you the time that I fell in love with you or that I realized it had happened, but I can’t. I just remember at some point I thought about you a LOT. When I woke up, when I fell asleep, while I was asleep, in the shower, when I ate, when I was at school, when I wasn’t at school. All. The. Time. I was in love. When songs came on and they talked about someone, I soon didn’t hesitate to associate every endearing lyric to you. I thought about you constantly and I smiled every time that I did. And each passing day I thought about you more and I was happier than the last. 
<br>
<br>
And nothing hurts more than when I upset you. It feels like a heavy weight on my chest that I can’t pick up. I want to be your biggest source of happiness. Your number 1 supporter and your favorite person to talk to. In the past I’ve had a few best friends but I feel like I have never hurt them like I hurt you. It’s a painful thing you know, to hurt or upset the person that you would literally die for. I would take a bullet for you in a heartbeat; I wouldn’t flinch or have to think about it even. I love you more than life itself. And I’m not on some Romeo-and-Juliet type shit here, but I would feel pretty damn empty without you. I’ve gotten a taste of how amazing life is with you and I don’t know that I could handle going back.<br><br><br> </p>
