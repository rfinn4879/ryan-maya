                <h1>A Message To My Love</h1>
                <p><br>I always hoped that I’d find love and be happier than ever but I didn’t think it would happen so early or even at all really. I was really happy before I met you. Like really happy. I was ecstatic like all the time. I loved life and everything it had in store for me. I rarely felt anything but a little bit of stress and happiness to be honest. I grew up watching disney and seeing everyone live a happy ever after with the love of their life, but I wasn’t sure I would ever truly get there. And plus, I was so happy already so I felt like love was just romanticized in movies. I remember thinking "Come on, could I really be missing that much?"
                <br>
                <br>
                Because I seldom felt anything but bliss, I didn’t think it was possible to raise my happiness threshold but my god you sure as hell did it. (I’m tearing up right now writing this so I know my sentences are probably all over the place so ignore that.) 
                <br>
                <br>
                When I’m with you I feel like I’m on cloud 9 and I know I’m the luckiest person ever. I set out to accomplish a lot in life and I’ve gotten now most of the things I’ve ever really wanted - Eagle Scout, Drum Major, Robotics CAD Lead, Good ACT Score/GPA, Success in Climbing, All West Placements. That was definitely just a little brag section but all that was to say that the fruition of our relationship, although it's the newest addition, it’s already become absolutely the best part of my life.

                So I guess I should start at the start. I still vividly remember the day I saw you first. I also remember getting an excited nervousness when you stood next to me one day (during band camp still) in block. I would take quick glances at you but I didn’t want you to notice and despite this I still had that whole don’t-date-outside-your-grade attitude so I told myself it wasn’t gonna work out anyway. I literally know that at one point I said to myself that I wanted to be in the same grade as you for that reason. And I didn’t care which way it went either; I wanted to join your grade as much as I wanted you to join mine. I just figured then we would have a chance. I barely saw you once school had started though and I didn’t think the possibility of an "us" very much until I started seeing you at football games. Then we sat in the stands and talked that one game and those butterflies came back for sure. I remember being quiet the whole time and thinking “if I don’t talk, I can’t make a mistake” but I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to make you laugh and see your smile. I wanted to make a good impression. And although that wasn't probably the most romantic meeting, I was happy that I didn't immediately ruin my chances. Random side note: I’m pretty sure I instagram stalked you sometime after that too. Anyway, then marching season came to a close and I don’t think I really ever got to see you. 
                <br>
                <br>
                That chapter of our life ended and I didn’t worry about it too much. Since I didn’t get too many opportunities to sit by you at football games, I didn’t think we even really had a chance. And since you're beautiful and fun to be around, I figured someone else would come and sweep you off your feet so, for the time, you really didn’t cross my mind much.
                <br>
                <br>
                You know how this next part goes: you add me on snapchat and we make awkward small talk in our first conversation where I show off Gus and we talk about homework. I've never told you this but I saw the notification that you added me back and I intentionally waited to add youb back to not seem too excited. Once again, I didn't want to risk anything by coming on too strong. I intentionally went outside, threw some music on, and started throwing the ball with Gus so that we would have something to talk about if things got dry. Of course awkward small talk ensued, but I didn't want you to know I was excited. I wasn't actually doing homework that night - I was passing the time with anything I could until I thought an acceptable amount of time had passed and I could respond. This whole "counting down time to respond" continued for a while until we started talking more and eventually staying up at night to do it. That was my favorite part of every day. I was excited to talk to you and I know I didn't finish some of my homework on time because I began to put you first. That's probably when I started to fall in love, and trust me - I'm still falling deeper in love with you every day.

                And I was all giddy on that spring break trip when you talked to me all week WHILE ON VACATION. That was an amazing feeling! To know that you would take time to talk to me while you were out of town. And not only take time, but to stay up into the morning to talk about the most random things with me. We literally had conversations about snapchat filters lol. That was the first time that I began to entertain the idea that you shared similar feelings towards me. 
                <br>
                <br>
                ALso, in the beginning I was so excited and nervous to talk to you that I wrote notes and never sent anything before proofreading it at leasat 11 times (I still do this and that’s why I still take so long to respond). I even took pictures of your snaps on my iPad mini sometimes because I was so nervous that I would forget what you said or that I would say the wrong thing and ruin what was becoming my favorite thing ever: our relationship. When we started doing videos I would count how many little 6 second markers were sent between us and even before that, how many pictures. I would always try to gauge whether or not you were interested in what were were talking about and my nervous self didn’t want to overdo it by sending more things and embarrass myself. I also remember that a few times I would let the conversation die to see if you would try to save it or start a new topic to keep talking. I would also play these dumb little fantasy games where I would be thinking about you or something and I’d be going back in forth about whether you wanted to be in a relationship or you thought we were better as friends. I would act out full scenarios of me asking you out and prepared for weeks to make sure that I had a composed response to any rejection. Based on whatever was going on in my head at the time, if you responded, I told myself that was how you felt or whatever. I was asking the universe to be my detective essentially. More often than not, it supported the concept that you loved me back, but I still couldn’t take that as accurate because I still rigged it in my favor.

                <br>
                I wish I could tell you the time that I fell in love with you or that I realized it had happened, but I can’t. I just remember at some point I thought about you a LOT. When I woke up, when I fell asleep, while I was asleep, in the shower, when I ate, when I was at school, when I wasn’t at school. All. The. Time. I was in love. When songs came on and they talked about someone, I soon didn’t hesitate to associate every endearing lyric to you. I thought about you constantly and I smiled every time that I did. And each passing day I thought about you more and I was happier than the last. 
                <br>
                <br>
                And nothing hurts more than when I upset you. It feels like a heavy weight on my chest that I can’t pick up. I want to be your biggest source of happiness. Your number 1 supporter and your favorite person to talk to. In the past I’ve had a few best friends but I feel like I have never hurt them like I hurt you. It’s a painful thing you know, to hurt or upset the person that you would literally die for. I would take a bullet for you in a heartbeat; I wouldn’t flinch or have to think about it even. I love you more than life itself. And I’m not on some Romeo-and-Juliet type shit here, but I would feel pretty damn empty without you. I’ve gotten a taste of how amazing life is with you and I don’t know that I could handle going back.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is really all a long-winded way to say "I love you." I figured there's no reason to hide anything here, so I threw in some details that I don't think I've ever told you. I hope you enjoyed reading that. I told you I always try to find the right words, and this wasn't as much as I had hoped to get down before today, but it's a start. I will continue to add to this and to remind you how much you mean to me. I love you!
